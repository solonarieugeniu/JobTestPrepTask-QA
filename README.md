# JobTestPrepTask-QA
Assignment: Part 1 - Manual Testing, Part Two - API Testing, Part Three - Automation Concept

Hello, 
Thank you for your time on checking this :)

1. Some of the tasks have been done in Jupyter Notebook, using anaconda, it was easier for me to write and generate the pdfs, no MS word formatting haos, so you may see some screenshots directly from there.
2. For the test cases I've used BDD format, we can do classical test cases or check lists but BDD was used for now.

#### For manual testing was used: swag labs: https://www.saucedemo.com/
#### For API testing was used: Pet store from Swagger: https://petstore.swagger.io/

BR,
Eugeniu
